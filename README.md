# Authoritarianism-project

This repository includes materials and data of my master's project on authoritarianism (OSF pre-registration: https://osf.io/d7a94/): R code, SPSS syntax and a codebook.

The data used for my analyses comes from wave 7 dataset of the longitudinal COVID‚Äê19 psychological research consortium (C19PRC) study (Bentall et al., 2020-2022). Information regarding C19PRC study can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/v2zur/).

Note that the raw dataset which was used for the analysis is not publicly available yet (28/08/2022), therefore neither raw dataset nor modofied version can be uploaded on this repository.
