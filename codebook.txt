Authoritarianism project: codebook

This study uses a wave 7 dataset of the longitudinal COVID‐19 psychological research consortium study (Bentall et al., 2020-2022; https://osf.io/v2zur/). 
Data was collected online at multiple time points. The sample (N for wave 7 = 1405) is a quota sample stratified by age, sex and education to match the UK population according to Office of National Statistics data.

Variables included in the final dataset used for my analyses (latent profile analysis & multinomial logistic regressions):
1. pid - participant ID
2. RWA (continuous variable) – calculated score on right-wing authoritarianism subscale; higher scores indicate higher right-wing authoritarianism (range: 5-25)
3. LWA (continuous variable) – calculated score on left-wing authoritarianism subscale; higher scores indicate higher left-wing authoritarianism (range: 5-25)
4. SA (continuous variable) – calculated score on sexual authoritarianism subscale; higher scores indicate higher right-wing authoritarianism (range: 5-25)
5. COVID (continuous variable) – calculated score on COVID-19 authoritarianism subscale; higher scores indicate higher COVID-19 authoritarianism (range: 5-25)
6. JS (continuous variable) – calculated score on justice seeking authoritarianism subscale; higher scores indicate higher justice seeking authoritarianism (range: 5-25)
7. Class (categorical variable) – variable resulted from running latent profile analysis conducted in RStudio; 1 = non-authoritarians, 2 = authoritarians about almost anything, 3 = anti-authoritarians, 4 = left-wing authoritarians
8. Age [in years] (continuous variable) – reported by participants
9. Gender (categorical variable): 1 = male, 2 = female, 3 = transgender, 4 = prefer not to say, 5 = other
10. Education_binary [this variable was not included in wave 7 dataset, however, since all participants answered education question in one of previous waves, this data was obtained by merging datasets] (categorical variable): 0 = did not attend post-secondary education, 1 = attended post-secondary education
11. EU_ref_vote [“in European referendum what did you do?”] (categorical variable): 1 = voted to leave the EU, 2 = voted to stay in the EU, 3 = did not vote, 4 = ineligible to vote because too young, 5 = ineligible to vote because not a UK citizen or resident
12. bully_child_TOTAL (continuous variable) – calculated score on frequency of bullying (9 items) in childhood; higher scores indicate more frequent bullying (range 0-45)
13. bully_adult_TOTAL (continuous variable) – calculated score on frequency of bullying (9 items) in adulthood; higher scores indicate more frequent bullying (range 0-45)
14. bully_others [single item: “have you ever taken part in bullying another person?”] (continuous variable): 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always, 0 = never (initially coded as 6 but recoded prior to running the analyses)
15. child_rearing_TOTAL (continuous variable) – calculated score on child-rearing scale (8 pairs of items; forced choice); higher scores indicate more authoritarian child-rearing attitudes (range: 0-8)
16. parent_rearing_TOTAL (continuous variable) – calculated perceived parent score on child-rearing scale (8 pairs of items; forced choice); higher scores indicate more authoritarian child-rearing attitudes (range: 0-8)

Note: the original dataset is not publicly available yet. 
When it becomes available, it will be uploaded on C19PRC OSF page along with a full codebook to the raw dataset.
